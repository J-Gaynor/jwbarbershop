## This project is built with NextJS and Tailwind. 
- [Demo here](https://jw-barbershop.netlify.app)
- [Live implementation](http://jw-bb.com/en/)

## Tech Stack
- Next.js: Framework for building React applications.
- React-Intl: Library for internationalization and translations.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first framework for styling.

## Project Overview
This project is my first implementation of Next.js, React-Intl, and Tailwind CSS. It showcases a bilingual barber shop website designed for a Japanese company, combining Japanese web design principles with an English layout.

## Features
- **Internationalization**:
  - Translations are stored in separate locale files. All site text is dynamically loaded using <FormattedMessage> from React-Intl.
- **Branch Structure**:
  - The main implementation can be viewed in the main branch.
  - Changes specific to the English-only version are in the eng-only branch.

## Context
The site was designed to complement the companyâ€™s existing Japanese website. The English version will be live, while the Japanese button links to their existing site rather than a translated version. Please view the live netlify demo to see the translation feature in action.
